## A funny story

When i was younger, i found a stray cat, my mother didn't want animals at home so i took it anyway and i hid it in my room, i managed to hide it for 1 week before my mother finds out. And in the end, i was able to keep it because i took care of him alone since 1 week.

#### TL;DR

I found a stray cat that i cannot keep because my mother, i keep it for 1 week hidden in my room, finally, she accepted to me to keep it because i took care of him.
